Welcome to Zewen Long's Personal Homepage!

I am a master student at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) (expected to graduate in June 2025). Additionally, I am a member at [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Shu Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qVge6YYAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in the field of Recommender Systems, with a focus on sequential recommendation. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI safety.

Playing Language Game with LLMs Leads to Jailbreaking

Yu Peng<sup>\*</sup>, **Zewen Long<sup>\*</sup>**, Fangming Dong, Congyi Li, Shu Wu, Kai Chen

We discover a new jailbreak attack method, that is playing language games with LLMs can bypass their safety alignment, and further observe that simple custom language games can also lead to jailbreaking.

GOT4Rec: Graph of Thoughts for Sequential Recommendation

**Zewen Long**, Liang Wang, Shu Wu, Qiang Liu, Liang Wang

We propose GOT4Rec, which first utilizes the graph of thoughts (GoT) prompting strategy in the sequential recommendation domain to capture three key types of information contained within user history sequences: short-term interests, long-term interests and collaborative information from other users.

[Personalized Interest Sustainability Modeling for Sequential POI Recommendation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3583780.3615278)

**Zewen Long<sup>\*</sup>**, Liang Wang<sup>\*</sup>, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu

**32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2023**

We propose a personalized interest sustainability modeling framework for sequential POI recommendation (INSPIRE) to capture whether each user's interest in specific POIs will sustain beyond the training time.
